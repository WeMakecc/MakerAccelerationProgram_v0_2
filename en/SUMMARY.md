# How to make a Maker in Residence

### Intro Call for Makers (how it started)

* Pre-call: [https://goo.gl/dHDMvu](https://goo.gl/dHDMvu)

* Call: [https://goo.gl/Bo9GQr](https://goo.gl/Bo9GQr)

*Contextualize the opencare Maker in Residence, describe the call, when it was organized, key points and values*

Since 2014 WeMake organizes a "Maker in Residence" (MIR) programme, an initiative that aims to enhance WeMake’s international network of designers and makers to develop partnerships and to accelerate projects with the support of skills and professionals within the makerspace community and network.

From April to September 2017 WeMake has opened the lab for a special edition of MIR: **opencare Maker in Residence**.

**opencare** started at the beginning of 2016, it is a project funded by EU, a global community working together to make health and social care accessible for all, open source, privacy-friendly and participatory.

**opencare** starts from the assumption that state and private institutions will be unable to meet the demands for care in the 21st century and that new, more open, participatory, community-based methods are required.

The **opencare MIR** is structured around workshops, making, discussions with experts, including engineers, programmers, designers, policymakers and community members.

In order to collect applications, spread the news and reach out possible participants a [Call for Makers](https://edgeryders.eu/t/maker-in-residence-program/6165) has been structured and opened from March 17th to May 31st 2017.

The Call for Makers was hosted on the Edgeryders platform, where part of the [application process](https://edgeryders.eu/t/maker-in-residence-program/6165) took place.

Teams interested in taking part in the programme had to publish a story (see [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/opencare/maker-in-residence) the stories of the applicants) and describe their project following these [guidelines](https://edgeryders.eu/t/about-the-maker-in-residence-at-wemake-category/53).

In order to complete the application an additional [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegOVLtcEd9eGMryRlHRwKqP_mSnZkz5YhyjmQ-nTGAQQLRjw/viewform?usp=sf_link) had to be filled, with logistics and private information.

A selection process followed these steps, resulting into the beginning of the residency program. WeMake, therefore, acted as an infrastructure to develop, improve and accelerate care-related projects, helping them find a shape and own viability.

* Why a MIR (values and benefits)

    * Why we are making it: [https://goo.gl/5yYxA2](https://goo.gl/5yYxA2)

*Point out the reasons why a MIR is a good opportunity for staff and residents to work together.*

The Maker in Residence format is one of the possible ways to engage makers and designers in an intense work and acceleration process.



This special edition was structured in order to create an active and participatory link between **online and offline collaboration**.

The dualism between these two dimensions is a central point in **opencare** project. On the one hand online collaboration can help getting inspiration; learning from all around the world experiences; finding technical documentation, forking and contributing to different projects.



The possibility to reside for a period of time in a makerspace, on the other hand, gives the possibility to actively collaborate with people, often being triggered to take a step forward; to use tools and materials that can act as a mind stimulus; to iterate project development day by day; to experience the so-called tacit knowledge, which is based on observation of other makers working, learning from their diffuse competencies and skills repository.

* * *


* How to carry out tutorship / acceleration / companionship / consultancy

The following sections are meant to be a model and source of inspiration to structure a Maker in Residence (or similar) process.

Sections are built on the steps required to carry out a complete system (application, selection, preparation, acceleration, assessment and documentation), and are mainly based on the opencare Maker in Residence. Amount and typology of steps may vary according to needs, contexts and other variables.

Examples and tools will be mentioned and described, in order to provide tangible references that could serve as a starting point for a future MIR or similar acceleration process.

    * Application process:

        * Form (public): [https://goo.gl/YX1h7y](https://goo.gl/YX1h7y)

        * Form (private): [https://goo.gl/McPgg2](https://goo.gl/McPgg2)

        * Stories (applications): [https://goo.gl/rSQ2j3](https://goo.gl/rSQ2j3)

*Hand out tips to set up and manage a call for makers.*

A [Call for Makers](https://edgeryders.eu/t/maker-in-residence-program/6165) (or artists, designers, creative people, ecc.) is a good way to spot and gather people or groups interested in joining the acceleration program.

In some cases it may not be necessary to work on the promotional aspects of this step (if the possible participants have already been spotted and selected). However, it is important to share with all the stakeholders the core values of the initiative, the offering and the expectations.

The call should include a brief overview of the program itself, and it should clearly point out:

* **who it is intended for**

e.g. individuals and/or teams of makers working on an open source and care-related concept or project;

* **what is offered and what are the benefits for participants**

e.g. accomodation, tools and machines, in-house skills, budget for materials, feedback from experts and from users, agile development environment, maker community, visibility of the project, final event exhibition.

* **what participants are expected to do**

e.g. project development, open source, transparency, community involvement

* **what is the selection process** (this topic will be addressed in detail in the following chapter)

* **how to apply**

e.g. step by step procedure

The application process may vary drastically and be deployed in different forms or on different platforms.

A [public online form](https://edgeryders.eu/t/about-the-maker-in-residence-at-wemake-category/53), whose results would be[ available](https://edgeryders.eu/c/opencare/maker-in-residence) to a selected audience (e.g. online community) could regard general information about the project, need to solve, beneficiary, solution, stage of development, technologies adopted, exc.

An additional [private form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegOVLtcEd9eGMryRlHRwKqP_mSnZkz5YhyjmQ-nTGAQQLRjw/viewform?usp=sf_link) would concern personal and privacy-related information, such as personal data (name and surname, age, country, phone number, email) and project/residency plan (MIR expected achievements and support, period of availability).

Needless to say that it important to establish an opening and closing date for the call, in order to communicate a defined time frame in which the applications will be accepted and reviewed.

* Selection process:

    * Staff’s pipeline: [https://goo.gl/GgkFJo](https://goo.gl/GgkFJo)

* Project mapping: [https://goo.gl/RTVbvs](https://goo.gl/RTVbvs)

* Evaluation Matrix: [https://goo.gl/iY865D](https://goo.gl/iY865D)

* Acceptance email: [https://goo.gl/2RCSp8](https://goo.gl/2RCSp8)

	*Provide templates and suggestions on how to map, assess and select participants.*

During and/or after the application/call it is possible to start the selection process.

The selection criteria must be decided in advance and preferably explicitly communicated in the call.

According to the amount of applications and complexity of contents the steps to undertake may be abundant, and be divided among different staff members (based on availability and expertise).

The following is an example of pipeline that has been used to evaluate 10 applications and has involved 4 staff members.

* Application received (form auto-responder)

* Project mapping and first assessment

* Send email to ask for further details (if necessary)

* Review email and additional information

* Second assessment and validate with evaluation matrix

* Acceptance / refusal communication

Project mapping, in this case, was an executive summary of the application content, straight to the point in order to facilitate the possibility to spot missing details and to carry out the second assessment, based on the evaluation matrix.

Here an example of evaluation matrix:

* Ability to help people (30 points)

    * Total population

    * Impact to quality of life of an individual

    * Help to care movement

* Feasibility of the project (30 points)

    * BOM (both hardware and software)

    * Production time

* Development strategy (10 points)

    * Tech risk

    * User testing potential

* User acceptance (10 points)

* Opensourceness (20 points)

    * Forkability

    * Reproducibility

Once the assessment process is complete it is important to communicate the outcome with the applicants.

This can happen mainly in two ways (private and public), that could work independently or simultaneously.

A private email is a good way to inform individuals and groups about the positive (or negative) result of the assessment. This method preserves anonymity and guarantees a direct contact with participants, allowing the organizer to ask for confirmation and personal details.

Here is an example of the acceptance email:

Dear  __________,

we’re writing to inform you on the outcomes of the evaluation process regarding  __________ program.

**Congratulations, ****your project has been ****selected!**

We are glad to welcome and host you for the period of time requested in your application form (see below).

From today going forward, we’ll start planning the calendar according to the activities useful for your project development. Thus, we should get in touch with you as soon as possible due to logistical and organisational reasons.

First of all, we introduce ourselves, even if you have probably already had a chance to talk to us: we are  __________, involved in the project  __________.

From now on, and especially during your stay, you can refer to us for any doubts or clarification.

1. We kindly ask you to confirm this personal data:

    * **Project Name**: __________

    * **Name and Surname (resident 1)**: __________

    * **Period of the residence**:  __________

    * **Name and Surname (resident 2)**:  __________

    * **Period of the residence**:  __________

    * **Name and Surname (resident 3)**:  __________

    * **Period of the residence**:  __________

1. We’d like to schedule a Skype call to discuss together some specific points useful for the calendar planning. Thus, we propose you to have this call on  __________ from __________ to  __________.

In the attachment you can find a summary statement which contains all the important information about what is going to happen during the residency. We kindly ask you to download and read it, in order to clarify some doubts or requests during the Skype call.

That's all folks! (For now)

Waiting for your reply,

Best Regards

A [public blogpost](https://edgeryders.eu/t/maker-in-residence-welcome-teams/832) or social media post could, in addition, acts as a kickstart of the initiative. Announcing the selected projects and presenting them publicly is a way to highlight the acceleration program and reach a wide audience, as well as interested communities of people that could possibly be involved in the projects in order to support them or benefit from them.

*Provide helpful information about preparing and structuring an acceleration process, considering logistics and project constraints.*

While contacting participants, it is fundamental to start planning and structuring the acceleration process, considering multiple elements related to design, logistics, timings, etc.

There are multiple ways to do so, and some specific tools can assist this process.

First of all, it is ideal to start defining an acceleration plan. This plan, whose activities will be explained in detail in the following chapter "Acceleration process", can take different shapes: service blueprint, executive planning, project management on Asana.

A service blueprint is a **complex operational tool** that provides a complete and detailed step by step description of a service, considering the customer journey, front stage touchpoints and backstage processes, and untangles the interaction among all the elements.

The service can be designed for the teams to accomplish the following tasks and actions (preferably communicated in advance with all the participants, digitally shared prior to their arrival and/or physically handed over together with an optional welcome kit):

* **co-creating a cutting-edge project plan** (through agile methodology, goals definition and strategy definition);

* **being introduced to the use of digital fabrication machines**;

* **being guided to use the right set of tools** (for prototyping, concept creation, co-designing, exc.);

* **getting feedback and testing the project** (by fellow makers, designers and target audience);

* **creating product documentation** (with pictures, blogpost, hardware or software details, exc);

* **keeping a project diary online** (with a description of the main activities carried out - including project kickstart, agile planning, prototype development, testing, exc.);

* **meeting and interacting with local community**.

The executive planning, on the other hand, is a detailed list of actions, tasks and activities, with descriptions, deadlines, assignee, location and task status (if completed or not).

It can be divided in sections, to help prepare and plan the acceleration process (like general planning, project preparation, acceleration activities, exc.), and it can be based on the service blueprint, exploding every single activity and creating an executive version of it.

In addition, Asana is a very useful management tool that helps keeping track of the tasks and operational activities, while at the same time creating a calendar with complete and incomplete ones. Asana projects can be shared with team members too.

In order to define actions and tasks, however, it is necessary to refer to single projects and teams, and to their own needs / characteristics / peculiarities. Scheduling a conference call before their arrival can help confirming details or redefining new ones, such as possible changes in the existing project since the application, use of budget, fast prototyping machines training, specific expertise needs, exc.

A good way to keep track of participants and have an overview about their participation and details is to create a file that can list all the useful information, that are usually needed before, during and after the acceleration process. These information generally are: project name, team members + email, tutors + email, project email (this mailing list can be created before the residency and include all the people involved in the process of each single team/acceleration), phone number, skype name, link to application, project folder and shared folder, residency period, exc.

	*Introduce acceleration tools and methodologies.*

The acceleration process may vary from project to project, depending on its needs and characteristics.

There are, however, common methodologies that could be adopted.

Here is a draft of a 2-weeks schedule, that can be changed and adjusted, as needed.

**Day 1**

* Check-in (arrival, documentation approvement);

* Have a look around (room and kitchen, makerspace, staff presentation)

**Day 2**

* Exchange information (project presentation and planning, calendar)

* Development and kick-off (machines training, agile planning)

**Day 3/4**

* Ongoing development (Project development - early prototype)

**Day 5**

* Ongoing development (review, workshop organization)

**Day 6**

* Ongoing development (workshop)

**Day 8/9/10**

* Ongoing development (debriefing post workshop, prototype development, tech revision, usability testing, review after testing)

**Day 11**

* Documentation (documentation wrap up)

**Day 12**

* Implementation and wrap-up (roadmap planning, event organization)

**Day 13**

* Implementation and wrap-up (public wrap-up and aperitif)

**Day 14**

Check-out (departure)

At the beginning it is fundamental to define the state of the art of the project and the desired outcome, together with the necessary tasks to achieve the goal. This activity can be partly accomplished during the previous steps of the process, but it is important to define these information together with the team when the acceleration starts (see below: Agile kick-off), in order to be sure that everyone is aligned.

The following matrix, called Project Release, helps keeping track of the work during the acceleration period, measuring the project development and outcomes and keeping the staff up to date and informed about the project and the process itself.

 Project release 0.1

* **Vision**:

        * Project name:

        * Team members:

        * Sprint period:

        * Value proposition:

* **Sprint goal**:

        * deliverable

        * list of features

* **List of t****asks + deadlines**:

* **Sprint output**:

        * list of features:

* **Tasks accomplished**:

spiegazione

This is part of various agile planning kick-off activities, usually implemented during the first days of the programme. The agile kick-off is a set of questions, usually moderated by a member of the staff, that the teams need to answer to.

These questions serve two goals: alignment of the team and expectation setting.

Here there are some of them, and related activities that can be carried out together with the teams:

* **Why are we here**: brainstorm the reasons behind team’s and members’ participation

* **Create an elevator pitch**: fill the gaps of this matrix

The (name of the project) __________ is a (description) __________ that (does what) __________, for (who or what) __________ that (does what) __________. Unlike (this existing project) __________ out project (does what) __________ .

* **Design a product box**: state the top three reasons why people would use the product, and write down a payoff.

* **Create a NOT list**: write down all the tasks necessary to finalize the project, and then prioritize them according to the time frame of the acceleration, while defining which ones will be accomplished and which ones won’t.

* **Meet your neighbors**: draw or write down a network of stakeholders and communities already or about to be involved.

* **Size it up**: set the deadline for each achievable task defined in the NOT list and use it as a reference for further activities.

According to the outcome of the Agile kick-off the staff will have to schedule, if necessary, knowledge transfer sessions, qualifications / lessons related to useful machines, tools or topics, meetings with experts, etc.

The executive planning is particularly handy in this moment, since it allows to adjust all those things that have been previously planned, according to real necessities and deadlines.

* Assessment and documentation process:

    * conference call assessment: [https://goo.gl/FjpzEp](https://goo.gl/FjpzEp)

    * MicroWebsiteTemplate: [https://goo.gl/yfUUqX](https://goo.gl/yfUUqX)

*Hand out templates and tutorials to carry out an effective project documentation and assessment.*

Every acceleration process should be followed by an assessment one.

Assessing project’s outcome, team’s work and staff’s responsibilities is a good way to evaluate the success or pain points of initiative, and to shape a better one in the future.

This could be done in multiple ways, that include having a feedback session with the resident team and discussing about different aspects that could be covered with the following questions or similar ones:

* How did you carry out your residency?

* Was it useful? What did you achieve?

* Can you share with us some positive things, or strong points?

* Can you share with us some negative things, or weak points?

* What would you have done differently?

* What didn’t meet your expectations?

* Do you have any extra comment?

* Would you repeat the experience?

* What are you planning to accomplish in the near future?

According to the answers a new and improved experience can be designed.

Documentation of projects and processes, in addition, is another aspect that is often underestimated and, once again, it can take different forms. Although the channel or medium used to document projects or processes is not strictly relevant, it is important to establish a routine that could help teams get used to the habit of making the project documented and understandable by a reference community of people.

A possible way to go is to create a microwebsite with the main purpose of making the project public and open to collaboration.

GitHub Pages, a static site hosting service by GitHub, can be set up as a multi page website with:

* An **Homepage**, with project value proposition, residency summary, video, news overview, licence and contributions, disqus form;

* An **About page**, describing scenario, journey, next steps and introducing the team;

* A **News page**, with blogposts and updates.
