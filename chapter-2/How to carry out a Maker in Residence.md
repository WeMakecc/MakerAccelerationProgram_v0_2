# How to carry out Maker in Residence

## or a tutorship / acceleration / companionship / consultancy

The following sections are meant to be a model and source of inspiration to structure a Maker in Residence (or similar) process.

Sections are built on the steps required to carry out a complete system (application, selection, preparation, acceleration, assessment and documentation), and are mainly based on the opencare Maker in Residence. Amount and typology of steps may vary according to needs, contexts and other variables.

Examples and tools will be mentioned and described, in order to provide tangible references that could serve as a starting point for a future Maker in Residence or similar acceleration process.
