During and/or after the application/call it is possible to start the selection process.

The selection criteria must be decided in advance and preferably explicitly communicated in the call.

According to the amount of applications and complexity of contents the steps to undertake may be abundant, and be divided among different staff members (based on availability and expertise).

### Selection pipeline

The following is an example of pipeline that has been used to evaluate 10 applications and has involved 4 staff members.

1. Application received (form auto-responder)

1. Project mapping and first assessment

1. Send email to ask for further details (if necessary)

1. Review email and additional information

1. Second assessment and validate with evaluation matrix

1. Acceptance / refusal communication

1. Public communication


#### Project mapping

Project mapping, in this case, was an executive summary of the application content, straight to the point in order to facilitate the possibility to spot missing details and to carry out the second assessment, based on the evaluation matrix.

#### Evaluation matrix

Here an example of evaluation matrix:

* Ability to help people (30 points)

   * Total population

   * Impact to quality of life of an individual

   * Help to care movement

* Feasibility of the project (30 points)

   * BOM (both hardware and software)

   * Production time

* Development strategy (10 points)

   * Tech risk

   * User testing potential

* User acceptance (10 points)

* Opensourceness (20 points)

   * Forkability

   * Reproducibility

Once the assessment process is complete it is important to communicate the outcome with the applicants.

This can happen mainly in two ways (private and public), that could work independently or simultaneously.

A private email is a good way to inform individuals and groups about the positive (or negative) result of the assessment. This method preserves anonymity and guarantees a direct contact with participants, allowing the organizer to ask for confirmation and personal details.

#### Acceptance communication

Here is an example of the acceptance email:

> Dear  __________,
>
> we’re writing to inform you on the outcomes of the evaluation process regarding  __________ program.
>
> **Congratulations, ****your project has been ****selected!**
>

#### Public communication

A [public blogpost](https://edgeryders.eu/t/maker-in-residence-welcome-teams/832) or social media post could, in addition, acts as a kickstart of the initiative. Announcing the selected projects and presenting them publicly is a way to highlight the acceleration program and reach a wide audience, as well as interested communities of people that could possibly be involved in the projects in order to support them or benefit from them.
